JAVA - Bucky video 33 (Multi-dimensional arrays)
==================================================
**************************************************

They are made when one wants to make a table or something that requires coordinates.
It has two square brackets first one for the row and the other for the column.


	int arr[] []={{32, 18, 78}, {34, 56, 1}};
or 
	int arr[] []={{32, 18}, {34, 56, 1}, {78}};
	


WHenever you want to call an element in the first element in the first row you use firstarray[0][1], in the second row one you use firstarray[1][0]
