JAVA - Installing JDK Windows
*****************************
=============================

Before writing any programs you need to install JDK, short forJava Developement Kit, which is a program that will allow you to write and compile (interpret to machine language) java code.

The installation will follow the steps below.

1. Download the JDK
   You can download from java.sun.com >> downloads >> JAVASE        (Starndard Edition) >> JAVASE Development kit >> download (>> means    go to the link under that name and click). This will download the       executable file you will need.

2. Locate the file you downloaded and double click which will start the    JDK installation wizard which might require you to agree to a bunch     of stuff and clicking next a couple of times and ou a la,JDK       installed! 

3. Once this is done we need to set up the java compiler, although it 	   comes as one of the basic functions of the JDK, it is not made          vailable by a simple the wizard installation there is a bunch of        other tricks required. The compiler is usually accessed through      CMD by typing javac, and the set up continues..
